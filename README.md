## Git Notes

> #### Frequently used commands for quick access

1. **Update the Existing Remote's URL**  
`git remote set-url <REMOTE-NAME> <NEW-URL>`  
**e.g** `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Zomato/Android`

2. **Clone repository in a folder from remote**
* First of all create folder and go into that folder using `cd` command
* Then clone here using command `git clone <url>`

3. To find out what branches are available and what the current branch name is execute `git branch`  

4. **Create and Do Switching between Branches :**
* `git checkout -b <new branch-name>` [ The **`git checkout`** command accepts a **`-b`** argument that acts as a convenience method which will create the new branch and immediately switch to it.]

* `git checkout <existing branch-name>` [ Switching branches is a straightforward operation. Executing the following will point **`HEAD`** to the tip of **`ÔºúbranchnameÔºû`**.]

* `git checkout -b Ôºúnew-branchÔºû Ôºúexisting-branchÔºû` [ By default **`git checkout -b`** will base the **`new-branch`** off the current **`HEAD`**. An optional additional branch parameter can be passed to **`git checkout`**. In the above example, **`Ôºúexisting-branchÔºû`** is passed which then bases **`new-branch`** off of **`existing-branch`** instead of the current **`HEAD`**.]

* `git reflog` [Git tracks a history of checkout operations in the reflog]

5. **Git Stash Commands** - git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
* **Create Stash**
  * `git stash` : changes saved with random name/stash created with random name.
  * `git stash -m "message for this stash"` : changes saved with a given name/message.
* **Show Stash**
  * `git stash list` : Get the list of all stash.
  * `git stash show` : shows the summary of the latest stash diffs.
  * `git stash show -p` : shows the summary of the latest stash full diffs.
  * `git stash show stash@{1}` : shows the summary of the specific stash diffs.
* **Apply Stash**
  * `git stash apply` : Apply latest/most recent changes to your work.
  * `git stash apply stash@{3}` : Apply specific stash changes to your work.
* **Delete Stash**
  * `git stash drop` : Delete the most recent stash.
  * `git stash drop stash@{1}` : Delete a specific stash.
  * `git stash clear` : Delete all stashes.
* **Apply and Delete Stash Simultaneously**  
  * `git stash pop` : Take the content from the latest stash and then apply those changes to our current working file, and remove that topmost stash. This command is very similar to stash apply but it deletes the stash from the stack after it is applied.
  * `git stash pop stash@{1}` : same as git stash pop but for specific stash id.   
* **Create Branch From Stash**
  * `git stash branch <branch_name>` : creates a new branch with the latest stash, and then deletes the latest stash (like stash pop).
  * `git stash branch <branch_name> stash@{1}` : creates a new branch with the specific stash, and then delete that specific stash.

6. `git merge` **Vs** `git rebase`  [[visual explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoXAv9M4boU)]
* `git merge` - It create new commit in `main branch` after combining commits of `new branch` and `main branch`.
* `git rebase` - Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a `sequence of commits` to a new base commit.
* `git rebase --abort` - Run this to completely undo the rebase. Git will return you to your branch's state as it was before git rebase was called.

7. `git fetch` **Vs** `git pull`  [[simple video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmagW60Li-o)]
* `git pull` - Used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content  
* `git fetch` - just used to check that there are any changes available, if yes then download latest changes using `git merge`
* `git pull = git fetch + git merge`

8. `git log` - Used to view the history of committed changes within a Git repository.
9. `git push` - Used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
10. `git remote -v` - It will list the URL of the remote repo.
11. `git log <branch_name> --oneline` - Only show commits of current branch.

12. **List all the committed files that are going to push to the remote repository**  
**P.S** The `git status` didn‚Äôt show the committed files.

- `git log` to display all the commit_id, the first one is the last commit_id, copy it
- `git show commit_id --name-only` to display all the files committed in the specified commit_id
- Undo the last commit with `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, move the mistakenly committed files back to the staging area

> #### Steps for setting up SSH key for your github account [To avoid authentication everytime while pushing to remote repo]
1. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mygithub@org.com"
2. No need to enter any passphrase, simply hit enter button.
3. Copy the SSH Key that is generated
4. `cat ./.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` you can use `cat` for printing your SSH Key which is stored in `pub` file.
5. After all these steps finally paste the SSH Key in your Github SSH Key and then everything done.
